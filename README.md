NOTE---

HEVoting is a web platform for online voting designed using [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/seal/... & blockchain core database), [Drogon](https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon/) and [Angular] angular just for testing of the voting mechanics(https://angular.io). 

It leverages the power of the [BGV](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/277.pdf) scheme to encrypt votes, and tally them on the server without decryption, ensuring vote confidentiality.

This project is still in development, and has been posted here for remote work.
